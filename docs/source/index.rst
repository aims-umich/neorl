NEORL (**N**\ euro\ **E**\ volution **O**\ ptimisation with **R**\ einforcement **L**\ earning) is a set of implementations of hybrid algorithms combining neural networks and evolutionary computation based on a wide range of machine learning and evolutionary intelligence architectures. NEORL aims to solve large-scale optimisation problems relevant to operation & optimisation research, engineering, business, and other disciplines.
