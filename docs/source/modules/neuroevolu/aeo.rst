Notes
-----

- Only valid in ``mode='min'``.
- AEO supports ``ES``, ``GWO``, ``WOA``, ``MFO``, ``SSA``, ``DE``, ``PSO`` and ``JAYA``.
- Algorithm objects must be defined prior to their inclusion in ``AEO`` (see example)
- Parameters such as ``F`` in ``DE`` or ``mu`` in ``ES`` are carried into ``AEO`` after initialization of these algorithms.
- Population size parameters such as ``nwolves`` in ``GWO`` are used to determine the starting populations but are changed as the algorithm progresses.
- ``fit``, ``bounds`` and ``mode`` should be consistent across algorithms passed into ``AEO``.
- The total number of function evaluation changes depending on the algorithms in the ensemble and the distribution of members.
- Information on the returned `log` can be found in the code for the ``AEO`` class.
- Extra options around the migration process can be accessed through the ``kwargs`` paramter.
